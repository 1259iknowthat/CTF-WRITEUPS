# **BEGINNER FORENCIS**

Well, it has been a long time since this event that I just have written this writeup LOL.

So, what are you waiting for? Let's go!

First challenge was the easiest one. They gave me something like this.

```
When I open this file in notepad, it looks very chaotic. Do you know what file it is?
Download file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/151mSsV5WKXq751UHAauTOx7Czfxkyqkt/view?usp=sharing
```

When I downloaded the file, the first look, it was like normal txt file but when I opened it up, it had PNG header.

After having corrected the extension of the file, I got this picture.
